<h2> The Global Load Balancing API </h2>
The <em>Global Load Balancing API</em> (GLB) aims to make it easy for application programmers to write
code which runs in multiple places and which can be load balanced across these places.

<p> The API is based on two basic ideas. Firt, the user code must supply a definition of a <en>task </em> 
type <code>T</code>, and implement a <code>TaskFrame[T]</code> class. There are no restrictions 
on <code>T</code>. Typically, it contains the minimum amount of information that should be stored in the
runtime for each task. For instance, in the case of UTS, <code>T</code> is <code>SHA1Rand</code>, a struct
which takes 20 bytes of storage. A <code>TaskFrame[T]</code> implements methods for running a task. Typically
it contains additional state (such as the values of various parameters) that are necessary to execute
a task.

<p> Second, the user creates an instance of a <code>GlobalRunner[T]</code> class, parameterized by 
the task type <code>T</code>. The constructor for <code>GlobalRunner</code> permits the programmer to
specify various parameters for load balancing. Additionally, the programmer must specify the set of 
places over which the global load balancer is to run (commonly, the unique distribution over all places
is supplied). The programmer must also supply a <em>task frame maker</em>: this is a nullary function
that on invocation returns an instance of <code>TaskFrame[T]</code>. The <code>GlobalRunner[T]</code> 
instance created will invoke this function once at every place.

<p> Finally, the user creates an initial task and supplies it to the created instance of 
<code>GlobalRunner[T]</code>. This task will be executed as the <em> root task </em> at the
place where the <code>GlobalRunner[T]</code> instance is created. Tasks created during its execution
will be balanced across all places. This method returns when the task has finished globally.

<p>
Optionally, the user may invoke a method on <code>GlobalRunner[T]</code> to obtain statistics of the 
execution

<h2>Example</h2>
Please see <tt>examples/UTS</tt> for more details. The following snippet of code illusrates a common
usage pattern:
<code>
  val g = new GlobalRunner[SHA1Rand](nu, w, e, l, z, Dist.makeUnique(), 
             ():TaskFrame[SHA1Rand] => new Binomial(b0, qq, mf));
  Console.OUT.println("Starting...");
  var time:Long = System.nanoTime();
  g.run(SHA1Rand(r));
  time = System.nanoTime() - time;
  Console.OUT.println("Finished.");
  g.stats(time, verbose);
</code>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
This is a very preliminary implementation of the API. 


<ul>
<li> The API supports only one worker per place. The user must set the following environmental variables:
<code>
export X10_NTHREADS=1;
export X10_DISABLE_DEALLOCS=1;
export X10_STATIC_THREADS=true;
</code>
</ul>
This limitation will be removed in future versions of this API.
