For the purposes of the tutorial, we have configured this project as 
a Java backend project.  This will allow the project to build on any
computer where X10DT can be installed. 

However, the various tests cases and examples are simpler to run
using the command line (top-level Makefile and associated scripts).
If you want to really build/run this code, we suggest you use the
command line (and most likely the C++ backend).
