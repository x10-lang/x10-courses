/**
    A clocked final variable with window size one. A clocked final
    variable represents a sequence of values, one for each phase of
    the underlying clock. For such a variable o, the value in the
    current phase can be read by invoking o(). The value in the next
    phase can be set by invoking o() = v. The activity can signal that
    it is ready to move by invoking next(). This is a blocking call
    --- on return, the object has moved to the next phase, and now
    calls to o() will return the value written in the last phase. If
    no value was written in the last phase, the value of the last
    phase will be returned.
    
    <p> An async may read and write multiple such variables.

    <p> Only asyncs registered on o.clock should operate on
    o. Otherwise the detgerminacy guarantees do not hold.
