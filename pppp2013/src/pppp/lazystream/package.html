This package implements lazy, recursively defined, potentially infinite, 
many reader, functional streams (cf Landin streams). As a stream is evaluated 
it turns into a sequence of cons'es, hence subsequent traversals of the stream 
are very cheap. The implementation is sequential.

<p> The central operation on a stream <tt>s</tt> (of type 
<tt>Stream[T]</tt>) is a <em>force</em> operation
(<tt>s()</tt>). This yields a <tt>Cons[T,Stream[T]]</tt> which provides
the first element of a stream, and (recursively) the rest of the stream
(sometimes called the "top-level cons"). This captures the idea of Friedman 
and Wise that "cons should not evaluate its arguments". To generate successive
elements of the stream the corresponding tails must be forced.

<p> In an eager language like X10 a thunk (an expression of type <tt>()=>T</tt>,
for some type <tt>T</tt>) is used to enforce delayed evaluation. 

<p> Various stream operators are defined which make it easy for 
programmers to write readable stream programs. See <tt>ppp.lazystream.examples</tt> 
for several example stream programs. 

<p>For recursive definitions over streams, care must be taken to ensure 
that each "force" of a stream evaluates its input streams to only as much 
depth as necessary in order to generate the top level cons.
Static methods and variables may be used for recursive definitions.
For example:
<code>
 public static def fact():Stream[Long]=()=>(x());
 static val x=1~(Stream.longNats(2)*fact());
</code>
<tt>fact()</tt> hides the stream being recursively constructed (<tt>x</tt>)
in a thunk, so that recursive evaluation is delayed. Now <tt>x</tt> can be
defined with recursive invocations of <tt>x<.tt> replaced by <tt>fact()</tt>.
(If the call to <tt>fact()</tt> in the body is replaced with
<tt>x</tt> the compiler will complain of illegal recursive initialization.
If the body of <tt>fact()</tt> is replaced
with <tt>x</tt>, the initialization of <tt>x</tt> will not terminate.)
A <tt>static</tt> rather than an instance method must be used to avoid
a <tt>this</tt>escaping problem with the closure in the body of the method.

<p> This package may be used as a basis for BigNums.
